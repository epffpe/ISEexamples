This message has been read from the XCF02S configuration PROM. It was
stored in the free space after the Spartan-3 configuration bitstream.
Clearly any information could be stored in this way including text messages, 
version and serial numbers, product codes, DSP filter coefficients and 
programs for processors, without the requirement for additional components.

To discover how to implement this in your own designs, an application
note (XAPP694) is available together with a design macro and the software 
utility which appends your unique data to the configuration PROM file.
Alternatively you can contact the author directly via email 
(stephan.neuhold@xilinx.com)who will be happy to discuss your application.

In this demonstration, the KCPSM3 variant of PicoBlaze is used as the 
controller for all the functions you can perform. The PROM reader macro is
used as a simple peripheral to accelerate the access rate to this message.
Although this simple demonstration accesses only one data set, the PROM 
could be used to store many data sets of various lengths.  PicoBlaze would 
be well suited to manage the retrieval of each data set as required. 

PicoBlaze is available at www.xilinx.com/picoblaze or directly from the 
author via email (ken.chapman@xilinx.com).
